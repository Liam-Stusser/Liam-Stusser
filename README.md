Hi my name is Liam, I'm currently relearning to code as its been two years since I last took a coding class.
I started learning in 2014 making batch files with notepad, moved onto java, did a game programming class in C#, took my schools ap comp sci class, and the last I did was in college where I learned python.

Was not sure if I wanted to program for a career so I spent a few years trying other jobs but, finally decided that I would like to focus on programming.
Now learning html, css, and java script to learn more about front-end development but would like to focus mainly on python, java, and C. 
I enjoy working on games and learning more about the development process, I was learning game development in unity before I stopped coding to focus on other jobs.
