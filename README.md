# 👋 Hi, I'm Liam

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a self-motivated developer currently sharpening my front-end and general programming skills after returning to coding with fresh energy and focus. My programming journey began in 2014 with batch scripts in Notepad. Since then, I've explored languages like Java, C#, and Python through various courses, including AP Computer Science and game programming classes.
